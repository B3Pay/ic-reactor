# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to IC Reactor! This page provides a quick overview of how to get started.

### Setup

pnpm install
pnpm build
```

### Formatting

We use Prettier for formatting. Format locally with:

Husky + lint-staged will format staged files automatically on commit.

Run unit tests:

```

If you are adding a feature, include tests and documentation where applicable.
