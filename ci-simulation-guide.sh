# IC Reactor CI Simulation Tools
# ===============================
# 
# This repository now includes several scripts to simulate the exact CI environment
# locally, helping you debug CI/CD issues before pushing to GitHub.

echo "=================================="

echo "Available simulation scripts:"
echo ""

echo "1. üìã strict-ts-check.sh"
echo "   Purpose: Runs strict TypeScript checks on all packages"
echo "   Use case: Find TypeScript issues that CI catches but local builds miss"
echo "   Command: ./strict-ts-check.sh"
echo ""

echo "2. üß† smart-ts-check.sh"
echo "   Purpose: TypeScript checks with proper dependency building order"
echo "   Use case: Test TypeScript compilation with dependencies built first"
echo "   Command: ./smart-ts-check.sh"
echo ""

echo "3. üèóÔ∏è simulate-ci.sh"
echo "   Purpose: Full CI simulation with clean environment (shows raw errors)"
echo "   Use case: See exact errors that would occur in CI without fixes"
echo "   Command: ./simulate-ci.sh"
echo ""

echo "4. ‚úÖ simulate-ci-fixed.sh"
echo "   Purpose: Full CI simulation with proper dependency order and checks"
echo "   Use case: Test complete CI workflow with all fixes applied"
echo "   Command: ./simulate-ci-fixed.sh"
echo ""

echo "üéØ Key Differences from Local Development:"
echo "‚Ä¢ CI uses strict TypeScript checking (--noImplicitReturns)"
echo "‚Ä¢ CI starts with clean node_modules (no cached builds)"
echo "‚Ä¢ CI enforces proper dependency build order"
echo "‚Ä¢ CI has NODE_ENV=production and CI=true environment variables"
echo ""

echo "üîß Issues Fixed:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Added return statements to all callback functions"
echo "‚Ä¢ Fixed 'not all code paths return a value' TypeScript errors"
echo "‚Ä¢ Ensured Parser builds before Core (dependency order)"
echo "‚Ä¢ Added proper error handling with return values"
echo ""

echo "üí° Usage Recommendation:"
echo "Run ./simulate-ci-fixed.sh before pushing to GitHub to ensure"
echo "your changes will pass CI/CD pipeline checks."
echo ""

echo "üöÄ All tools are executable and ready to use!"
