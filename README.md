Welcome to IC-Reactor, a comprehensive collection of TypeScript libraries designed to simplify and enhance frontend development on the Internet Computer (IC) blockchain platform. This project provides a set of tools that cater to various aspects of frontend development, ranging from vanilla JavaScript applications to sophisticated React-based projects.

## Versatility Across Front-End Development

Whether you're building a simple vanilla JavaScript application, a complex React project, or anything in between, the IC-Reactor suite is equipped to support your development process. By abstracting the complexities of blockchain interactions and state management, these libraries allow developers to focus on building feature-rich, responsive, and user-friendly front-end applications on the Internet Computer platform.

IC-Reactor is heavily typed and provides type safety, ensuring that your code is robust and free from common errors. With strong typing, you can catch potential issues at compile-time and benefit from better code completion and documentation, developers can efficiently handle a range of tasks from querying and displaying blockchain data to managing user authentication states - all within the familiar ecosystem of JavaScript and React.

# @ic-reactor/react [![@ic-reactor/react](https://badge.fury.io/js/@ic-reactor%2Freact.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ic-reactor/react)

`@ic-reactor/react` is a React library designed to seamlessly integrate Internet Computer (IC) blockchain interactions into your React applications. It simplifies the process of managing actor states, performing queries, and handling updates within the IC blockchain ecosystem.

## Key Features

- **React Context Integration**: Utilizes React Context for managing global state related to IC actors.
- **Custom React Hooks**: Provides custom hooks (`useQueryCall`, `useUpdateCall`, `useAuthClient`) for easy interaction with IC actors.
- **Simplified Actor Interaction**: Streamlines the process of querying and updating data from IC actors.
- **Efficient State Management**: Manages loading, error, and data states efficiently within React components.
